/**
 * The project contains the implementation of MUSE algorithm for the purpose 
 * of multimodal route planning. The project requires a dataset available at:
 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5276749
 * 
 * MUSE has been sumbitted to the Transportation Science Journal in a paper
 * entitled "MUSE: Multimodal Separators for Efficient Route Planning in 
 * Transportation Networks".
 * 
 * This project also includes the implementation of the SDALT algorithm as
 * described in the paper. It allows for reproducing the stated performance
 * evaluation.
